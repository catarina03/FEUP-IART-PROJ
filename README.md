## Project 1: Adversarial Search Methods for Two-Player Board Games   

We chose to implement the game [Neutreeko](https://www.neutreeko.net/neutreeko.htm) in Python.  
In order to have a human-computer and computer-computer game mode, we developed an AI that runs the Minimax algorithm. The different difficulty types correspond to different variants of the algorithm (with/without alpha-beta pruning, different maximum depth).  

**How to run:** [README](Project1/README.md)  
**Source code:** [Project1/src](./Project1/src)  
**Final presentation:** [Final-Slides.pdf](Project1/docs/Final-Slides.pdf)   
**Final grade:** 18.0/20

## Project 2: Supervised Learning 

Our goal was to correctly label stock as buy-worthy or not. In order to accomplish it, we used the entries from the [Beat US Stock market
(2019 edition)](https://www.kaggle.com/cnic92/beat-us-stock-market-data) data set, which contains the 10-K filings of 638 Tech Companies, to train and test our predictive model.
